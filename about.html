        <p>I am a 39 year old male (born September, 1986) who is a citizen of the United States and am currently residing in the country of The Philippines. I grew up spending copious amounts of time studying chess and teaching myself programming and how to use computers. I also learned to love sports and enjoy physical activities like walking, hiking, playing tennis, playing various other sports (just for fun and for exercise and perhaps a little friendly competition).</p>
        
        <p>After graduating from the University of Washington in Seattle, WA USA in 2008 with a B.S. in chemical engineering I got a job in process engineering and worked only for a short time before there was a major economic catastrophe in the USA which shaped many people's lives, including mine. I was laid off less than 1 year after starting this first job out of college and I found myself questioning life and the purpose and meaning of it.</p>
        
        <p>It was at this time I started attending church and I heard and believed the gospel of Jesus Christ. I was subsequently baptized in the summer of 2009 at age 23 and gave my life to God and his son Jesus Christ. I subsequently found an obliquely related field of work with Honeywell Process Solutions and worked for them for about 3 years. I was then offered an opportunity that after much deliberation I decided would be better for me in the future. It was about 1 year after I accepted this job with a military contractor called GP Strategies working on a simulator of a process control system that I was baptized by the Holy Spirit, which profoundly changed my life even more than when I initially was introduced to Jesus and his saving grace. It was at this time I received many spiritual blessings, witnessed many truly supernatural miracles and God brought me through a season "in the wilderness" where I had many trials and difficult times (including problems with mental health, homelessness, financial difficulties as a result, and tensions within my immediate family). This started around 2013 and even as all this was happening I still continued to tutor math and continued to attend church and read the Holy Bible and pray always. I didn't have it easy, but I learned a lot about God and I am very grateful for this time in my life because it taught me to prioritize and think clearly, with perspective, about my life.</p>
        
        <p>In 2023 I found a lovely woman on a Christian dating site called Plenty of Fish. We got married after speaking to each other for about 9 months via video call, much praying and fasting and talking with our loved ones and trusted friends, months of pre-marital counselling offered through my church, and meeting each other in person in Cyprus where my wife happened to be working at the time (she is a citizen of the Philippines). As of October 2025 we have been married for 2 years and we are both happily serving God in his kingdom together and serving our neighbors in our local community. We attend Jesus is Lord church together on a regular basis but we ultimately worship God in the spirit and in truth and so we are not always in physical attendance at a particular church building, we believe God is everywhere and that we can worship him wherever we are.</p>
        
        <p>I am currently making a transition between jobs. As I am located in the Philippines I am looking for remote work in data analysis, data science, or a related field. While I am pursuing that goal of a new career in data analysis I might also take a job in the short term as a math tutor online with a platform that allows for internationally located tutors.</p>
        
        <p>I am also currently studying theology, SQL programming, Python programming, chess, statistics (frequentist and Bayesian approaches), and I still enjoy taking experimental high-range intelligence tests; both for the joy I get from solving the problems and for the reminder that God made me differently, motivating me to work hard and share my unique abilities with others.</p>
        
        <p>Other things I am interested in include poetry, song-writing, gift-giving, personal health and fitness and nutrition, longevity, psychometrics in a general sense, investing, and learning other languages (although I will admit, this is not one of my strong abilities).</p>
