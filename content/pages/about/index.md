    title: About Andrew
    subtitle: >-
  I am a 38 year old male (born September, 1986) who is a citizen of the United States and am currently residing in the country of The Philippines. I grew up spending copious amounts of time studying chess and teaching myself programming and how to use computers. I also learned to love sports and enjoy physical activities like walking, hiking, playing tennis, playing various other sports (just for fun and for exercise and perhaps a little friendly competition).

  After graduating from the University of Washington in Seattle, WA USA in 2008 with a B.S. in chemical engineering I got a job in process engineering and worked only for a short time before there was a major economic catastrophe in the USA which shaped many people's lives, including mine. I was laid off less than 1 year after starting this first job out of college and I found myself questioning life and the purpose and meaning of it.

  It was at this time I started attending church and I heard and believed the gospel of Jesus Christ. I was subsequently baptized in the summer of 2009 at age 23 and gave my life to God and his son Jesus Christ. I subsequently found an obliquely related field of work with Honeywell Process Solutions and worked for them for about 3 years. I was then offered an opportunity that after much deliberation I decided would be better for me in the future. It was about 1 year after I accepted this job with a military contractor called GP Strategies working on a simulator of a process control system that I was baptized by the Holy Spirit, which profoundly changed my life even more than when I initially was introduced to Jesus and his saving grace. It was at this time I received many spiritual blessings, witnessed many truly supernatural miracles and God brought me through a season "in the wilderness" where I had many trials and difficult times (including problems with mental health, homelessness, financial difficulties as a result, and tensions within my immediate family). This started around 2013 and even as all this was happening I still continued to tutor math and continued to attend church and read the Holy Bible and pray always. I didn't have it easy, but I learned a lot about God and I am very grateful for this time in my life because it taught me to prioritize and think clearly, with perspective, about my life.

  In 2023 I found a lovely woman on a Christian dating site called Plenty of Fish. We got married after speaking to each other for about 9 months via video call, much praying and fasting and talking with our loved ones and trusted friends, months of pre-marital counselling offered through my church, and meeting each other in person in Cyprus where my wife happened to be working at the time (she is a citizen of the Philippines). We are now approaching our two year anniversary in October of 2025 and we are both happily serving God in his kingdom together and serving our neighbors in our local community. We attend Jesus is Lord church together on a regular basis but we ultimately worship God in the spirit and in truth and so we are not always in physical attendance at a particular church building, we believe God is everywhere and that we can worship him wherever we are.

  I am currently still working as an online tutor with WyzAnt.com. I have expanded the subject areas I tutor as I have expanded the subject areas I am capable of explaining well. I am not perfect but I do have a perfect rating on WyzAnt, 5.0/5 with hundreds of ratings and much positive feedback at [my WyzAnt tutoring profile](https://www.wyzant.com/match/tutor/85283819).

  I am also currently studying theology, SQL programming, Python programming, chess, statistics (frequentist and Bayesian approaches), and I still enjoy taking experimental high range intelligence tests for the joy I get in solving the problems on them and remembering that God made me different from other people and that I need to work hard to share my unique abilities with others.

  Other things I am interested in include poetry, song-writing, gift-giving, personal health and fitness and nutrition, longevity, psychometrics in a general sense, investing, and learning other languages (although I will admit, this is not one of my strong abilities).
